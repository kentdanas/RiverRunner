# RiverRunner - Whitewater Kayaking Predictions - Functional Specifications

## BACKGROUND

Whitewater kayaking is a popular sport around Washington state where there are many runnable rivers within a short drive from urban areas.... 

## USERS

The target users of RiverRunner are individuals who whitewater kayak in Washington state and would benefit from knowing in advance whether a river will be runnable. This could include recreational paddlers, professional paddlers, kayaking competition organizers, and kayaking companies. 

For all of these users, the computer experience required to use the tool is general familiarity with operating simple web-based graphical user interfaces. The domain knowledge required is familiarity with the sport and the impact of river flow levels on paddling conditions. Users will need to understand what it means for a river to be within its stated runnable flow range, as well as how conditions could change given a certain margin of error in the predicted flow rate. 

## USE CASES

Paddlers will use this tool to help plan their kayaking trips by getting a prediction of a selected river's daily flow rate up to two weeks in advance, which will provide an indication of whether the river is runnable. The user will access the tool through a webpage, and select a river run by name from a drop-down filter. The system will respond with a plot of that run's historic flow rate for the past four weeks along with the flow rate predicted by the model which will extend up to two weeks into the future. The plot will include a highlighted band between the maximum and minimum runnable flows for the selected run so the user can easily identify whether the predicted flow rate falls in the desired range. The tool also includes a map which will update based on the selected river run to show the put-in and take-out locations. Paddlers should be able to use this tool to more accurately plan kayaking trips to rivers that will be runnable and are close to a desired flow range without further than one day in advance.
