# Example of Using River Runner
River Runner provides flow rate predictions for whitewater kayaking runs via a simple web-based user interface. To access predictions for a given run the user has the following options:
 - Choose a run from the dropdown menu at the top of the page. Runs can be found by scrolling through the list alphabetically, or by typing into the search bar
 - Choose a run from the map. Points on the map represent the run's put-in location
